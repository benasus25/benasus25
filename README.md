### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a project that creates a private and secure communication channel among authorized users of a group. You can find more about that at - [Github repo](https://github.com/benasus25/intra-organisational-server)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and TypeScript. I would also love to dabble in the world of web 3.0
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to join and enrich communities that support developers like me to refine and grow among ourselves. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help in starting with open source contributions and how to find the right 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about DSA and backend development. I seem to have developed a good grasp on both of them.
- ðŸ“« Reach me at [Gmail](sparshsinha.spavis@gmail.com) or simply drop a dm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sparshtwts)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I almost took the same amount of time in figuring what to write as I took to actually do all of these.
