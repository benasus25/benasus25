### Hi there 👋

<!--
**benasus25/benasus25** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a project that creates a private and secure communication channel among authorized users of a group. You can find more about that at - [Github repo](https://github.com/benasus25/intra-organisational-server)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and TypeScript. I would also love to dabble in the world of web 3.0
- 👯 I’m looking to join and enrich communities that support developers like me to refine and grow among ourselves. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help in starting with open source contributions and how to find the right 
- 💬 Ask me about DSA and backend development. I seem to have developed a good grasp on both of them.
- 📫 Reach me at sparshsinha.spavis@gmail.com or simply drop a dm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sparshtwts)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I almost took the same amount of time in figuring what to write as I took to actually do all of these.
